        <h1> About the Yorkshire Terrier:</h1>
        <p>Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, 
        old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became 
        the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies. The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size terrier of 
        no more than seven pounds whose crowning glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a rich 
        golden tan. Don't let the Yorkie's daintiness fool you. Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, 
        the Yorkie exhibits all the traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog breed in various 
        American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are 
        favorites of urbanites the world over. Yorkies are long-lived and hypoallergenic (the coat is more like human 
        hair than animal fur), and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true 'personality breed, providing years 
        of laughs, love, and close companionship.

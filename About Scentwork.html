        <h1> What is Scentwork?:</h1>
        <p>The sport of Scent Work celebrates the joy of sniffing, and asks a dog to sniff to their hearts content; turning your dogs favorite activity into a rewarding game. It is a terrific sport for all kinds of dogs, and is a wonderful way to build confidence in a shy dog.
            In so many dog sports the handler is in control but this isnt true in Scent Work. Neither the dog nor handler knows where the target odor is hidden. The handler has to rely on the dog, and follow the dogâ€™s nose to success. In Scent Work, it is the canine who is the star of the show.
            The sport of Scent Work is based on the work of professional detection dogs (such as drug dogs), employed by humans to detect a wide variety of scents and substances. In AKC Scent Work, dogs search for cotton swabs saturated with the essential oils of Birch, Anise, Clove, and Cypress. 
            The cotton swabs are hidden out of sight in a pre-determined search area, and the dog has to find them. Teamwork is necessary: when the dog finds the scent, he has to communicate the find to the handler, who calls it out to the judge.
